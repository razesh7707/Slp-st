		<P>Normally, when we need inspiration, we look at the works of our favorite marriage photographers. We look for your photos, we observe carefully every detail, we ask ourselves what has that photo to captivate us and we analyze in detail the answer to try to reach those same results with our camera. But the great Wedding photographers have also left us another legacy as motivating to reflect on marriage photography and appreciate it even more if it fits: its most famous appointments. Surely right now you just come to a phrase in your head, right? </P>
		<p>We have compiled what we consider the 60 phrases of most famous photographers, but there are many more. Do you know any other that you would add to the list? Which is your favorite? Maybe you also have your own inspiring phrase, do you dare to share it with us in the comments</p>
